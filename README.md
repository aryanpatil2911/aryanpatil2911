I work with AWS as my cloud platform and have a keen interest in cloud technologies. My projects cover multiple domains, including AWS [basics](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-basics.git), [networking](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-networking.git), [databases](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-databases.git), [security](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-security.git), [containers & compute(AWS EBS with Docker](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-containers-compute.git), [3-tier web applications(serverless Lambda + API Gateway)](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-3tier-webapp.git) and [integrating Ai with AWS cloud technologies](https://github.com/aryanpatil2911/aws-ai.git).  
I am keen to explore and learn Data Science, Ai, and Machine Learning alongside my cloud engineering work and plan to leverage Ai and cloud technologies.
